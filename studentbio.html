        <p>My name is Brian Mehl, I was born in Durban, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa on April 13th, 1992. My family emgirated to America in 1996 when I was 4 years of age to get away from the political and social turmoil that still grasps at South Africa today. We first lived in California before moving to Utah; I have lived in Utah for almost 18+ years!</p>
        <p>Some hobbies of mine include making music, snowboarding, hiking, traveling as much as possible, and hanging out with my wild Basenji puppy Huxley!</p>
